## bamazon

#### bamazon is a sales/inventory/management tool which consists of three JavaScript modules: bamazonCustomer, bamazonManager, and bamazonManager. Each of these modules use MySQL, JavaScript, and node.js technologies. All modules use npm inquirer to construct a user interface using questions. Each module connects to MySQL via npm mysql.

#### bamazonCustomer allows a customer to purchase an item after viewing a list of available items. If a sufficient number of items are available in inventory, the customer's purchase is completed and the number of items and total cost are displayed. If there is not sufficient inventory, a message is shown. In both instances the customer is taken back to the start screen.

#### bamazonManager provides the following tools: view all products for sale, view producs with less than 5 items in inventory, add more items to current inventory, and add a new product to the product list.

#### bamazonSupervisor can be used to display overhead cost, total sales, and profitability by department. The manager can also add a new department to the departments table.
